# ReCDTV
ReCDTV is an Open Hardware remake of the Commodore CDTV mainboard, revision 2.2.1.

## Status

WIP. Almost all the chips are in the correct (ish) locations with their pins all correctly on the right nets.

## Summary
This came about because I bought a CDTV that had been utterly destroyed by a ham fisted monkey who for unknown reasons appeared to have attempted to remove the Paula socket with a blowtorch and a chisel. 

While there are schematics out there for the CDTV I'm not aware of any remakes.

You will almost certainly need a CDTV to build this, unfortunately the drive in a CDTV is unique to it so even if you could manage to find all the parts you would be able to do anything without the drive!

I have attempted to use "new" parts where possible however some are NLA or were Commodore only parts. You will have to harvest them from an Amiga or CDTV.

## Known Schematic errors

There are some differences noted between the schematics and the actual board. These are noted here. 

1) RP1 and RP2 are the wrong way round on the schematics/board.
2) RP23 & RP24 don't exist on the Rev 2.2.1 board (although there appear to be locations for them).

## Differences from Original

V1 is intended to be a functional "like for like" copy. 

All of the non-Commodore/Amiga unique parts have been sourced as far as they can. 

Unfortunately as a number of the chips are unique to the CDTV this isn't a project that is of much use *except* to fix a broken CDTV. 

The routing is "kind of" like the original however I have focused on functionality over being identical. 

## Unobtainium (non Commodore) parts.

TBC - This will list "regular" parts that are NLA.
