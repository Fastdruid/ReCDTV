# ReCDTV
ReCDTV is an Open Hardware remake of the Commodore CDTV mainboard, revision 2.2.1.

## Status

Barely started. Nothing exists yet beyond a board layout and I've not uploaded anything yet. :) 
At worst this will be a bare board layout for other people to create new designs that will fit within a CDTV chassis.

## Summary
This came about because I bought a CDTV that had been utterly destroyed by a ham fisted monkey who for unknown reasons appeared to have attempted to remove the Paula socket with a blowtorch and a chisel. 

While there are schematics out there for the CDTV I'm not aware of any remakes.

You will almost certainly need a CDTV to build this, unfortunately the drive in a CDTV is unique to it so even if you could manage to find all the parts you would be able to do anything without the drive!

I have attempted to use "new" parts where possible however some are NLA or were Commodore only parts. You will have to harvest them from an Amiga or CDTV.

## Differences from Original

V1 is intended to be a functional "like for like" copy with only two notible changes, the first being support for VBB and 8375 (2Mb) Agnus and the second to be able to add the extra memory. 

All of the non-Commodore/Amiga unique parts have been sourced as far as they can. 

Unfortunately as a number of the chips are unique to the CDTV this isn't a project that is of much use *except* to fix a broken CDTV. 

The routing is "kind of" like the original however I have focused on functionality over being identical. 

## Unobtainium (non Commodore) parts.

TBC - This will list "regular" parts that are NLA. 

## Other things of note.

## Assembly

Haha.

- SukkoPera, JasonsBeer, John "Chucky" Hertell and any others that have created or contributed to open-sourced Amiga designs. They have been invaluable for a bunch of stuff.
- Commodore - For making a cool machine that was massively before its time!
- [Amiga PCB Explorer](http://amigapcb.org) - A massively useful tool to follow original boards.
- [amigawiki](https://www.amigawiki.org/doku.php?id=en:service:schematics) - Not so much for CDTV but useful for the other schematics
